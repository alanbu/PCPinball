<title>PC Play Pinball for RISC OS</title>
</head>
<body>
<H1>PC Play Pinball 1.0</H1>
<p>This is a conversion of a 90's DOS pinball game called PC Spiel Pinball.
</p>
<p>The conversion has 2D flat graphics and dodgy physics, but I still find it fun!!!
</p>
<p>Many thanks go Ansgar Scherp and Joachim Gelhaus who wrote the original
version in Turbo Pascal and released the source code with a non-restrictive copyright.
</p>
<p>This version coded in C with the help of the SDL library.
