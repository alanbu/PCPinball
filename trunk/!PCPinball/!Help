Original version in Turbo Pascal, called PC Spiel Pinball, was written by Ansgar Scherp and Joachim Gelhaus.

Many thanks to them for releasing the source with a non-restrictive copyright.

The original game had a second table. If enough people are interested I
would see if I could produce a second game using this other table.
